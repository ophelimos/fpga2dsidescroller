why ? Because every project needs a readme :)

----------- NOTES ----------------
----------------------------------


- detectCollision has not been tested

- make level1 level_mem() 4-bit wide (in main_state_machine)
	- To do this, we need a 4-bit bmp2mif

- drawCharacter is buggy - it moves the character across the screen (and repeatedly loops the animation)
- drawTile is buggy - it draws what seems to be the last pixel line first
